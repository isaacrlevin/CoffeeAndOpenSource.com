Hi, my name is Isaac Levin, and I am developer who loves in Open Source. I see Open Source as a place for anyone to learn, play and innovate. I hope that folks coming here can help build this idea I have into something meaningful. Throughout my career I have relied on OSS to do my job, with little idea of the work it takes to build and maintain Open Source Software. This my attempt to give back... FINALLY! Here we will interview folks in Open Source, learn new OSS concepts via live streaming and blogs, and whatever else comes to me.
