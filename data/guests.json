From developer to product manager to entrepreneur (twice!), Nikhil's experience lends itself to both sides of the internal tool development conversation. Engineers need helpful internal software, but hate actually sitting down and making it for themselves. And businesses must use tools if they want to scale properly.<br /><br />Nikhil wanted to find a way to turn the arduous work of app-making into a streamlined process that would only cost engineers hours instead of months. So he teamed up with Arpit Mohan and Abhishek Nayak to create Appsmith, a program built to put easily customizable tools directly into developers’ hands. What started as a small open-source project has become a program that is used daily by over 10,000 teams, employs people in eight different countries, and has raised over $50 Million in capital. With a project built by engineers, for engineers, Nikhil is helping companies work better and dream bigger.",

Whether it be a new application, a new kitchen or a new RC helicopter, you will see him building things all the time. Most of the time, that means writing code and solving problems for clients at a company called Active Solution in Stockholm though. Except for the many days he spends at conferences and usergroups, talking about doing things he is passionate about, and for the days he goes mountain biking, IPSC shooting, kiteboarding or RC helicopter flying.For the last 15-something years, he has been solving problems for customers, and loving it. But if he gets to choose, he'll go to the beach and kitesurf every day!",

As she moved into consulting, her focus on defending technology systems and personal privacy grew to the point where she was advising fortune 100 companies on how to build comprehensive security programs.<br /><br />Alyssa is now the CISO at New York based Epiq Global. Still very much a hacker to this day, she’s built on that identity to grow her career. She is an internationally recognized public speaker and author of “Cybersecurity Career Guide”.

He holds strong information technology skills and expertise in Shell scripting, C++, operating systems, FreeBSD, and system administration. He started learning about open source in the 90’s where he was involved in developing web services using a very early version of FreeBSD. From that experience, he learned the basics of shell interface and how to check his e-mail without a GUI by using the “pine” command, which according to him, “was very uber-l33t” at the time. During his college years, Kris played around with other Unix and Linux platforms (caldera Linux, SuSE), however when he needed to do serious work, such as setting up a web or file server, he always fell back to his FreeBSD roots. To this day, he still prefers FreeBSD because it offers a greater degree of stability than other operating systems.",

    "GuestBio": "My name is Jeremy Miller and I am a Developer and Software Architect in Austin, TX.<br /><br />I started my career as a “real” engineer and got into software development writing automation tooling for my engineering group. This being the late 90’s, it was easy to transition into the early project automation groups where I got to be part of several initiatives to automate large construction project workflows. I was able to turn that experience into a real programming job at a Fortune 500 company. After a couple years of slogging through old style waterfall development, I discovered Agile Software Development and have mostly stayed in that world ever since.<br /><br />I was at the forefront of early Agile usage in .Net and for better or worse was one of the main folks behind the short-lived ALT.Net movement. I’ve also been very active in .Net OSS development starting with the old StructureMap library and on to many other projects since. I’m currently the lead developer on the Marten project.<br /><br />Since then I’ve swung between product shops and consulting companies before starting with MedeAnalytics this year heading up their new software architecture team.",
